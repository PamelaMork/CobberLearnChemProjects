This simple code plots the number of carbon atoms in the alkane on the x-axis and the boiling points of that alkane on the y-axis. It generates a properly labeled graph using Matplotlib.
This is part of the CobberLearnChem Machine Learning course through Concordia College.

While contributing publicly through my coding projects, Iâ€™m also developing a private portfolio to reflect on how these experiences are shaping my ethical awareness and scientific identity.

HelloWorld: This is the first code written to test PyCharm and to practice committing and pushing to GitHub.

AlkaneBoilingPoints: Learning to install libraries and to plot graphs.
